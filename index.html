            <h2>The mission</h2>

            <p>The main goal of the conference is very clear. We want to help <b>Ruby professionals</b> become better at
                what they do. Wroc_love.rb serves best to people who are already fluent with Ruby. The ideas presented
                at our conference are very advanced. They are meant to inspire the way we write code, the way we help
                our clients and users. It’s not uncommon for us to present you ideas that come from the Java and .NET
                worlds, we believe that their ideas can have a great influence on our community. There are good reasons,
                why our conference is called “the best Java conference in the Ruby world”.</p>
        </header>
        <header class="major">
            <h2>Experiments</h2>

            <p>Our goal is to ensure a good environment to learn and discuss. We love confronting ideas, even when it’s
                uncomfortable to the Ruby status-quo. We love experimenting with new formats of talks and discussions,
                like fights, fishbowls and crowd-moderated discussion panels. Everything that can inspire the Ruby
                programmers is more than welcome at our conference. Let us know, what you’d be interested in
                experimenting with!</p>
        </header>
        <header class="major">
            <h2>Inspiration and safety</h2>

            <p>Conferences are not only about listening. Most of the value comes from talking to each other. Our mission
                is to create an inspiring, thoughtful, creative and safe space to everyone involved. <b>The venue</b> is
                known to be of good quality - it’s a University of Wroclaw building. It has many ways to ensure safety
                of all the people inside like monitoring and special security people.<br/> It is needless to say that this conference is
                a place for good people, only. Good people respect each other, are nice to each other, smile, and make
                everyone (without exceptions) feel comfortable.</p>

            <h2>Who we are</h2>

            <p>Wroc_love.rb started as an activity of the DRUG (Wroclaw User Group) organization. However, over time,
                people loved it so much that the organization team grew to much more than that. Wroc_love.rb is now
                organized by Rubyists from many different Polish regions.</p>
